Welcome to *Grokking Simplicity*, a book about functional
programming by Eric Normand.

This source code distribution is a companion resource to
*Grokking Simplicity* available from Manning. To purchase a
printed and/or electronic copy of the book, please visit
https://lispcast.com/gs .

The book presents source code examples in JavaScript. The
examples are not intended to be run. They are there only to
illustrate the various skills and concepts in the book. You
may, however, want to follow along with the refactorings on
your own. So the code is here.

The code is organized by chapter first, then by section. You
will find a directory for each chapter and a file named
after the section in which the code is found.
